        RubyMine smartly takes care of the Ruby gems that are required for your project:
        detects unresolved references and informs you about the missing gems,
        leaving you with the task to install the required gems using the Gem Manager.
        Depending on your platform, find the Gem Manager in <span class="control">File | Settings </span> (on Windows and *nix), 
or <span class="control">RubyMine | Preferences</span>, on the page <span class="control">Ruby SDK and Gems</span>.</p>
