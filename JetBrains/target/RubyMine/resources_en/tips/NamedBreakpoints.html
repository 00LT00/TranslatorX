<h1>[96/173] NamedBreakpoints(命名断点) <a href='http://www.pingfangx.com/xx/translation/feedback?from=tips'>[汉化反馈]</a></h1>

<p>If there are too many breakpoints in your application, ease the search by
giving them names.</p>

<p>To add a name to a breakpoint, show the list of all breakpoints (<span class="shortcut">&shortcut:ViewBreakpoints;</span>), 
right-click the one you are interested in, and edit its description.

</p>
<p>When later you'll look through the list in search of a particular breakpoint, 
just start typing its name:</p>
    <p class="image"><img src="images/named_breakpoint.png"></p>
